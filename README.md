# FlexSignal AI

FlexSignal AI is an Azure-hosted forecasting and decision-support platform for the Danish electricity system, initially focused on DK1 and DK2.

Version `v0.1` is read-only decision support. The platform may forecast, visualize, explain, and recommend actions for human review, but it must not automatically control electricity consumption or send control signals to assets, plants, devices, or energy infrastructure.

## MVP Scope

- Forecast electricity surplus risk for DK1 and DK2.
- Visualize forecast windows, confidence, and expected economic potential.
- Explain model output and recommendations in clear text.
- Support human decision-making with auditable recommendations.
- Keep LLM usage limited to explanation, reporting, and recommendation text.

## Not Included in v0.1

- Automatic activation of consumption or flexibility.
- Live control signals to any assets, plants, devices, or energy infrastructure.
- Critical operational system responsibilities.
- LLMs as the primary forecasting engine or sole decision-making component.
- Production infrastructure deployment.
- Database schema implementation.
- Backend or frontend implementation code.

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: Next.js and TypeScript
- Backend: Python FastAPI
- Database: PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB
- Data jobs: Azure Functions or Azure Container Apps Jobs
- Hosting: Azure App Service or Azure Container Apps
- Secrets: Azure Key Vault
- Logs: Application Insights and Log Analytics
- Auth: Microsoft Entra ID
- AI/LLM: explanation and report generation only

## Local Development

TODO: Add local development instructions after the initial backend, frontend, and database setup is defined.

## Compliance Principles

- Read-only decision support in `v0.1`.
- Human review before any operational action.
- No autonomous control.
- No control signals to energy infrastructure.
- Auditability for forecasts, recommendations, explanations, and user actions.
- Least-privilege access to systems and data.
- LLMs are limited to explanation and reporting, not core forecasting or final decision-making.
