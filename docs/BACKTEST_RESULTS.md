# Backtest Results

## Status

FlexSignal AI now includes a pure Python backtest evaluator for
`rule-engine-v0`. It is a synthetic/local evaluator only: callers provide a
list of local row dictionaries, and each valid row is passed to
`calculate_surplus_risk`.

No real historical backtest has been run yet. This document does not claim
validated production performance, predictive accuracy, or statistical
calibration.

## Synthetic Preview Script

`scripts/risk_backtest_preview.py` provides a manual local preview of
`evaluate_risk_backtest(rows)` using a tiny hardcoded synthetic dataset. The
sample rows are included only to exercise low-, medium-, and high-like
rule-engine outputs, missing-data counters, and one invalid row captured in
`failed_rows`.

Run it manually:

```bash
python3 scripts/risk_backtest_preview.py
python3 scripts/risk_backtest_preview.py --pretty
```

The script prints a JSON summary of the evaluator output. It does not read a
historical dataset and does not establish model validity.

This preview is not a real historical backtest, not model validation, not
statistical calibration, and not evidence of production performance. It is only
a local smoke preview of existing deterministic aggregation behavior.

## Reported Metrics

`evaluate_risk_backtest(rows)` reports:

- `total_rows`: number of supplied rows
- `evaluated_rows`: rows successfully evaluated by `rule-engine-v0`
- `failed_rows`: rows rejected by validation or other row-level errors
- `risk_level_counts`: counts for `low`, `medium`, and `high`
- `average_risk_score`: average score across evaluated rows
- `average_confidence_score`: average confidence across evaluated rows
- `reason_code_counts`: aggregate reason-code frequencies
- `missing_price_count`: evaluated rows with missing price data
- `missing_generation_data_count`: evaluated rows with missing production or
  renewable generation data
- `failed_row_errors`: row index, error type, and error message for failed rows
- `model_version`: `rule-engine-v0`
- `decision_support_only`: `true`

Invalid rows do not stop the whole evaluation. The evaluator captures row-level
errors and continues with remaining rows.

## Limitations

- The evaluator only summarizes deterministic `rule-engine-v0` outputs.
- It does not fetch, clean, or validate a historical dataset.
- It does not train a model or tune thresholds.
- It does not calculate precision, recall, false positives, false negatives,
  MAE, RMSE, or calibrated probabilities because no labeled historical
  evaluation dataset has been run.
- Results depend entirely on the caller-provided local rows and the current
  rule-engine behavior.
- Average scores are descriptive summaries of evaluated rows, not forecasts.

## Safety Boundary

The evaluator is read-only decision-support tooling. It does not connect to a
database, execute SQL, call live APIs, poll external services, create ingestion
jobs, or use LLMs.

It does not perform or trigger automatic control, dispatch, activation,
closed-loop workflows, asset connections, plant/device commands, or live
control signals.

The synthetic preview script follows the same boundary: it uses hardcoded local
rows only and does not require `DATABASE_URL`, fetch live Energi Data Service
data, call HTTP APIs, run backend or frontend servers, use Azure, train ML
models, or add operational behavior.
